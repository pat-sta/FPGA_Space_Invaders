# FPGA_Space_Invaders

Adaptation of Space Invaders in SystemVerilog for the Altera DE2-115 FPGA. 

This was a partner project with Pouya Akbarzadeh (https://github.com/OfficialPouya)

This is a final project for UIUC's ECE 385 course, Digital Systems Lab.

I have ommited the code in this repository to avoid the possibility of students currently taking the course to copy and reuse our code for their final project.
